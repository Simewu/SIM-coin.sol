SIM is a deflationary token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain under contract [0xF3a2A13E4c0C3FE7BA7ceFB8f272e9653eaE528c](https://bscscan.com/token/0x5df196e555b57608a367e54da2e4abc830d0385a).

The deflation occurs by burning 5% of all every transaction, which not only limits the supply but incentivises holding it.

## How to buy

Using the [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/) app, navigate to the DApp: [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/), and Connect your wallet by selecting "Connect".

In the "From" field, select the token you'd like to transfer, then in the "To" field, enter the smart contract: SIM (`0xF3a2A13E4c0C3FE7BA7ceFB8f272e9653eaE528c`). If the transaction fails, be sure to incrementally increase the slippage percentage within the PancakeSwap settings. At the time of writing this, 6% is the minimum slippage that gives a successful transaction.
