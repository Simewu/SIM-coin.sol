# SIM Coin

SIM is a deflationary token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain under contract [0xF3a2A13E4c0C3FE7BA7ceFB8f272e9653eaE528c](https://bscscan.com/token/0x5df196e555b57608a367e54da2e4abc830d0385a).

## Token Supply and Future Ambitions

The deflation occurs by burning 5% off every transaction, which not only limits the supply but incentivises holding it due to the increasing rarity.

The initial token supply was 2 billion SIM. 1 billion was sent to [0x0](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xaa8547a7348357d7a064910691ac8596ad981ffcb3ebeb71436326d60446519a) for burning. 0.5 billion was sent to the [PancakeSwap liquidity pool](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5c1e02cafa29307fa6eb620a650cd2a7084387e994a0e328f4d96f5716cb67a4), and the other 0.5 billion will be distributed to upcoming exchange liquidity pools.

## Eco-friendly Finance

The goal of this project was to be lightweight and built on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. The lightweight nature of the coin ensures that no gas is wasted, and PoS enables the token to have a low impact on the environment, avoid all unnecessary computation, and have high throughput during network congestion. 

## How to Buy

Using the [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/) app (or any Smart Chain wallet), navigate to the DApp: [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x5df196e555b57608a367e54da2e4abc830d0385a), and connect your wallet by selecting "Connect".

In the "From" field, select the token you'd like to transfer, then in the "To" field, enter the smart contract for SIM:
```
0xF3a2A13E4c0C3FE7BA7ceFB8f272e9653eaE528c
```
If the transaction fails, be sure to incrementally increase the slippage percentage within the PancakeSwap settings. At the time of writing this, 6% is the minimum slippage for a successful transaction.
